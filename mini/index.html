		<h1>I have to push the pram a lot.</h1>
<p>What do you mean? She looks like one. I am your king. Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! A newt? Now, look here, my good man.</p>
<p>I'm not a witch. Well, she turned me into a newt. The nose? We found them. Ni! <strong> Ni!</strong> <em> Ni!</em> Ni!</p>
<h2>Now, look here, my good man.</h2>
<p>Who's that then? No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. What a strange person. Who's that then?</p>
<ol>
<li>The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!</li><li>Look, my liege!</li><li>Why do you think that she is a witch?</li>
</ol>

<h3>You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!</h3>
<p>Oh, ow! You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!</p>
<ul>
<li>Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot!</li><li>Camelot!</li><li>You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!</li>
</ul>

<p>And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Burn her! Oh, ow! But you are dressed as one… Where'd you get the coconuts? Well, I got better.</p>
<p>Well, how'd you become king, then? Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! We want a shrubbery!! Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Burn her!</p>
<p>I'm not a witch. Well, I didn't vote for you. Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! Be quiet! And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place.</p>
<p>Bloody Peasant! And the hat. She's a witch! I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</p>
<p>And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</p>
<p>How do you know she is a witch? I am your king. Shut up! Why do you think that she is a witch? On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. Did you dress her up like this?</p>
<p>Well, I didn't vote for you. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.</p>
<p>Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! But you are dressed as one… Look, my liege! Oh, ow! Be quiet!</p>
<p>Bring her forward! Look, my liege! We want a shrubbery!! Did you dress her up like this? Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.</p>
<p>Now, look here, my good man. Well, she turned me into a newt. We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!</p>
<p>The nose? Burn her! You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!</p>
